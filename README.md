# YY MANET Routing Protocol
Machine learning aided Mobile Ad-Hoc Network routing algorithm for non-cellular peer-to-peer internet connection for long-haul trucking companies and its scaling to a distrbiuted cross-border Internet Service Provider network. The project is part of our master thesis in the program Master of Electronics and ICT and the course of machine learning at KU Leuven 2020-2021.

An interested viewer can see our [intermediate presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wSUYTxIUXoch9rcxPmtjoh3Qz6APbAm0r32Uk30vmIY/edit?usp=sharing) from January 2021, which is meant to be an informative tease of what the project is about. 
It will be later followed by a complete published thesis and a well-documented README along with sourcecode, both available in the present repository.
